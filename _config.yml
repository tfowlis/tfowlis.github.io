# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am an aspiring software developer, with roughly 10 years(on and off) experience in programming. I have worked with C++, C#, Vulkan,Avalonia,SDL, and various
  other libraries for a plethora of small projects. I am currently working on my first large project, BLK_MTN. BLK_MTN is a software and hardware suite designed
  to allow for communications in high risk, heavily degraded, or low service environments. If any readers would like to know more, feel free to contact my email.

  I am also a military veteran. I served 6 years onboard the USS Nitze(DDG 94(. I was a CTT, or Cryptologic Technician - Technical. My main job was the analysis
  of non-communicatoins systems, working closely with other intelligence professionals to allow decisionmakers to stay informed, and ahead of the enemy.
